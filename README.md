# Cobalt Oxide theme for Typora
A dark theme for Typora, a multi-platform Markdown Editor. Directly based on the [Cobalt Theme](https://github.com/elitistsnob/typora-cobalt-theme) created by [Kent Pribbernow](https://www.github.com/elitistsnob). Which in turn was inspired by Wes Bos's [Cobalt](https://www.github.com/wesbos) theme for Sublime.
