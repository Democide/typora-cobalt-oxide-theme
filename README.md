# Cobalt Oxide theme for Typora
Based on the [Cobalt Theme](https://github.com/elitistsnob/typora-cobalt-theme) created by [Kent Pribbernow](https://www.github.com/elitistsnob). Which in turn was inspired by Wes Bos's [Cobalt](https://www.github.com/wesbos) theme for Sublime.

This version of the theme has the following changes:

- A different splash screen
- Adding colors to italic and strong text
- Provides some improvements to the sidebar 
- Properly colors the menus as well
